        Hi there, my name is Colton Egbert. I’m a 25 year old entrepreneur and software engineering student. This site serves as a virtual resumé of my experiences and interests. I hope that it can be helpful for a visitor that might be determining my ability to work well in a specific environment or on a certain project.

Some general information about me is that I was born and raised in Nevada, USA and was homeschooled all through high school. I have always had an ambitious spirit and started many small businesses as a young boy and teenager. In adulthood I’ve started and currently run 2, 7 figure corporations that are described in more detail on the Business Ventures page of this website.

I also grew up with an interest in music and taught myself to play the piano and organ quite proficiently as well as some basic guitar and cello. I wrote several of my own songs, did contract work for a video game soundtrack, and put on a community musical. 

I’ve also always had an interest in things mechanical and construction related. This comes in part because of my experience working for my dad as a teenager. I worked at a geothermal power plant that used the water from the energy production as a secondary product in alfalfa fields. My work there varied from operating heavy equipment to rebuilding turbines, welding, fabricating, farm work and everything in between. This motivated me to rebuild a classic car when I was 16.

I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Portugal, where I lived for 2 years as a volunteer. I worked hard and rose to the highest attainable leadership position in the mission and directed a body of over 150 volunteers while traveling around the country giving training and hands-on assistance for the longest tenure of any other missionary in my position. Under my direction, the mission far exceeded its loftiest objectives.

Upon return home from my mission, I went to a semester of business school at Brigham Young University and simultaneously attained my private pilot’s license at a local airfield. I decided that instead of learning about starting a business in a classroom, I would start one for myself and gain practical experience so after that semester I married my high school sweetheart and together we moved to Portugal to start our first company together.

After nearly 2 years in Portugal, we returned to the states where I decided to start another company in California with an old friend of mine from high school. Both of those companies are now growing and I manage them remotely from my farm that I purchased in Missouri where I am completing my software engineering degree online.

      <h3>Business Ventures</h3>
      <p>
        When I was 7 years old I asked my dad to help me build a chicken coop in the backyard and after filling it with birds and knocking the neighbor’s doors I started my first business - Egbert Eggs! 15 years and many small ventures later, my first real corporation was formed in Lisbon Portugal.

As shared on the Home Page, my wife and I moved to Portugal in 2020 with the intention of starting a business in the country that I served in as a missionary. My fluency with the local language and network of good people that I’d gained from my prior service equipped me with the confidence to do business in a country that I’d learned to love for many reasons.

My idea was to bring something unique from the United States to Portugal, something that they didn’t already have. Randomly, the idea that came to mind was to open an axe throwing venue. I confirmed that nothing of the sort existed in the country, and I’ve loved throwing axes since scout camp where I got my Eagle.

We were able to secure our first small location and get some targets built out and the doors open. Unfortunately, we could not have foreseen the impact that COVID-19 would have on our business in its first few months. On top of being forced to limit venue capacity and business hours, at one point having to close for a 3 month period, we received word from our landlord that changes were coming and that they would be demolishing our building so we had to evacuate. 

During this time, things looked very bleak for USAxe Club. My Portuguese business partner gave up on the project and left the company and I was left nearly penniless with nothing to show for it. My wife and I couldn’t stand the thought of going home failures though so we hit the streets and found a new venue that would offer us favorable enough terms while we rebuilt. 

This time we added a full service restaurant and built out and staffed the venue ourselves. Bit by bit it started to gain momentum and popularity. Now, in 2024, we have 2 locations in Portugal and our restaurant/axe throwing venues have served over 100,000 customers from 180 world nations. We have ambitious goals for expansion throughout Europe over the next couple of years.


The other company that I recently started and run is called eLawns. We are an all-electric landscaping service provider. This was an idea that I had as I know that especially in California there is a big push away from small gas engines but a lot of landscaping to be done. 

I started this company in a similar way to USAxe Club, bootstrapping with my own savings and labor until I could afford to hire employees. It is taking off though and we’ve shifted our focus now from residential to customer customers such as HOAs, municipalities, business parks, etc.

My experiences as founder and president of these companies have taught me far more than I believe a Master’s degree ever could. I have learned amazing lessons about working with partners, hiring and managing staff, supplier and customer relationships, strategic growth, marketing, minimum viable products, accounting, legal, company structure, etc.

I am motivated to grow these companies and invest in others moving forward. My main focus though at this point is starting the non-profit that I’ve been developing for the last couple of years to really make a difference in the lives of people less fortunate than me.
