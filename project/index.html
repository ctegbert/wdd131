        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Colton Egbert. I’m a 25 year old entrepreneur and software engineering student. This site serves as a virtual resumé of my experiences and interests. I hope that it can be helpful for a visitor that might be determining my ability to work well in a specific environment or on a certain project.

            Some general information about me is that I was born and raised in Nevada, USA and was homeschooled all through high school. I have always had an ambitious spirit and started many small businesses as a young boy and teenager. 
        </p>   
        <p>In adulthood I’ve started and currently run 2, 7 figure corporations that are described in more detail on the Business Ventures page of this website.
            
            I also grew up with an interest in music and taught myself to play the piano and organ quite proficiently as well as some basic guitar and cello. I wrote several of my own songs, did contract work for a video game soundtrack, and put on a community musical. 
            
            I’ve also always had an interest in things mechanical and construction related. This comes in part because of my experience working for my dad as a teenager. I worked at a geothermal power plant that used the water from the energy production as a secondary product in alfalfa fields. My work there varied from operating heavy equipment to rebuilding turbines, welding, fabricating, farm work and everything in between. This motivated me to rebuild a classic car when I was 16.
            
            I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Portugal, where I lived for 2 years as a volunteer. I worked hard and rose to the highest attainable leadership position in the mission and directed a body of over 150 volunteers while traveling around the country giving training and hands-on assistance for the longest tenure of any other missionary in my position. Under my direction, the mission far exceeded its loftiest objectives.
        </p>   
        <p> Upon return home from my mission, I went to a semester of business school at Brigham Young University and simultaneously attained my private pilot’s license at a local airfield. I decided that instead of learning about starting a business in a classroom, I would start one for myself and gain practical experience so after that semester I married my high school sweetheart and together we moved to Portugal to start our first company together.
            
            After nearly 2 years in Portugal, we returned to the states where I decided to start another company in California with an old friend of mine from high school. Both of those companies are now growing and I manage them remotely from my farm that I purchased in Missouri where I am completing my software engineering degree online.
